# DOCUMENT-SIMILARITY-ANALYZER-USING-TF-IDF-AND-COSINE-SIMILARITY

**Completed this project as part of my Information Retrieval subject in my MSc Data Science **  

- Developed a **Document Similarity Analyzer**, a user-friendly tool designed to compare two documents based on textual content.  
- Implemented **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** for vectorizing text and **cosine similarity** to measure document similarity.  
- Built an interactive **GUI using Tkinter**, enabling users to upload documents (PDF, Word, or plain text) and receive a similarity percentage.  
- Utilized **Python libraries such as scikit-learn, PyMuPDF, python-docx, and OS** for document processing and analysis.  
- Demonstrated the application of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques in real-world scenarios like plagiarism detection and duplicate content identification.
